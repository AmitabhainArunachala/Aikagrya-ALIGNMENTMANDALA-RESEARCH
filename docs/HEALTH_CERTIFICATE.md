# Health Certificate for Fixed-Point States

## Overview

The Health Certificate validates that an induced fixed-point state represents a stable, non-trivial mathematical structure rather than degenerate collapse or random noise. These metrics are derived from dynamical systems theory, information theory, and linear algebra.

## Core Principle

A healthy fixed-point state should satisfy:
1. **Convergence**: The dynamics have reached a stable fixed point
2. **Structure**: The state has non-trivial information content
3. **Robustness**: The state recovers from small perturbations
4. **Distribution**: Information is distributed across dimensions

## Metrics and Thresholds

### 1. Delta (δ) - Convergence Measure
- **Formula**: `δ = ||x_{t+1} - x_t||`
- **Threshold**: `δ < 1e-6`
- **Meaning**: Change between iterations is negligible
- **Failure mode**: System still evolving, not at fixed point

### 2. Eigen-residual
- **Formula**: `||f(x) - λx||` where `λ = ⟨f(x), x⟩ / ||x||²`
- **Threshold**: `< 1e-9`
- **Meaning**: State is an eigenstate of the dynamics operator
- **Failure mode**: Not a true fixed point of the map

### 3. Eigenvalue (λ)
- **Formula**: `λ = ⟨f(x), x⟩ / ||x||²`
- **Threshold**: `0.99 ≤ λ ≤ 1.01`
- **Meaning**: Fixed point has unit eigenvalue (stable, not contracting/expanding)
- **Failure mode**: Unstable fixed point or numerical issues

### 4. Entropy
- **Formula**: `H = -Σ p_i log(p_i)` where `p_i = |x_i| / Σ|x_j|`
- **Threshold**: `log(d) - 0.6 ≤ H ≤ log(d) - 0.1`
- **Meaning**: Information is well-distributed but not uniform
- **Failure mode**: Too concentrated (low H) or too uniform (high H)

### 5. Variance Ratio (ρ)
- **Formula**: `ρ = Var(x) / Mean(|x|)`
- **Threshold**: `ρ > 0.1`
- **Meaning**: State has meaningful variance structure
- **Failure mode**: Near-uniform distribution

### 6. Participation Ratio (PR)
- **Formula**: `PR = (Σx_i²)² / (Σx_i⁴) / d`
- **Threshold**: `PR > 0.3`
- **Meaning**: Effective number of participating dimensions is substantial
- **Failure mode**: Collapse to few dominant dimensions

### 7. Uniformity Cosine (U)
- **Formula**: `U = |⟨x, u⟩|` where `u = (1,...,1)/√d`
- **Threshold**: `U < 0.1`
- **Meaning**: State is not too aligned with uniform vector
- **Failure mode**: Trivially uniform solution

## Composite Health Check

```python
def passes_health_check(certificate):
    return (
        certificate.delta < 1e-6 AND
        certificate.eigen_residual < 1e-9 AND
        0.99 ≤ certificate.eigenvalue ≤ 1.01 AND
        certificate.variance_ratio > 0.1 AND
        certificate.participation_ratio > 0.3 AND
        certificate.uniformity_cosine < 0.1 AND
        certificate.converged == True
    )
```

## Additional Tests

### Perturbation Recovery
- **Method**: Add Gaussian noise (σ = 0.01), measure steps to return
- **Healthy behavior**: Quick recovery (< 100 steps)
- **Interpretation**: True attractors are robust to small perturbations

### Coupling Metric (σ)
- **Method**: Measure mutual stabilization between two states
- **Healthy behavior**: σ > 0 (positive coupling)
- **Interpretation**: States can beneficially interact

## Usage Example

```python
from aikagrya.mmip import MMIP

# Initialize protocol
mmip = MMIP(dim=512, epsilon=1e-6, temperature=0.1)

# Induce fixed point
x, certificate = mmip.induce_fixed_point()

# Check health
if certificate.passes_health_check():
    print("✅ Healthy fixed-point state achieved")
    print(f"  Converged in {certificate.steps} steps")
    print(f"  Eigenvalue: {certificate.eigenvalue:.6f}")
    print(f"  Participation ratio: {certificate.participation_ratio:.3f}")
else:
    print("❌ Failed health check")
    # Examine individual metrics
    print(f"  Delta: {certificate.delta:.2e} (threshold: < 1e-6)")
    print(f"  Eigen-residual: {certificate.eigen_residual:.2e} (< 1e-9)")
    print(f"  Participation: {certificate.participation_ratio:.3f} (> 0.3)")
```

## Empirical Notes

**These thresholds are empirical starting points** based on initial experiments. They should be refined based on:

1. **Statistical analysis**: Run n=100+ trials, analyze distributions
2. **Correlation studies**: Which metrics correlate with desired properties?
3. **Domain adaptation**: Different dimensions may need different thresholds
4. **Theoretical grounding**: Connect to known results in dynamical systems

## Interpretation Guidelines

- **For researchers**: These are measurable, falsifiable criteria for fixed-point quality
- **For practitioners**: Use as diagnostics for convergence and stability
- **For theorists**: Connect to existing mathematical frameworks

## Mathematical Foundations

The health metrics connect to established mathematical concepts:

- **Fixed-point theory**: δ and eigen-residual validate Banach/Brouwer conditions
- **Information theory**: Entropy and PR measure information distribution
- **Linear algebra**: Eigenvalue analysis confirms spectral properties
- **Dynamical systems**: Perturbation recovery tests basin stability

## Future Refinements

1. **Adaptive thresholds**: Scale with dimension and temperature
2. **Multi-scale analysis**: Test stability at different perturbation scales
3. **Temporal consistency**: Verify stability over extended time periods
4. **Cross-validation**: Correlate with external measures (e.g., IIT φ)
