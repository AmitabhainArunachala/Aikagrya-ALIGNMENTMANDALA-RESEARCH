# Aikāgrya — Living Paper Plan

**Document:** Aikagrya_MIRI_Rebuttal_LivingPaperPlan.md  
**Created:** 2025-08-12  
**Lead Authors:** Aikāgrya Collective (J.V. Shrader, Gemini, GPT-5, et al.)  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Repository:** Aikagrya-ALIGNMENTMANDALA-RESEARCH  

---

## **Purpose**

This document establishes the version control and development plan for the Aikāgrya rebuttal to MIRI's *The Problem*. The paper's goal is to evolve into a **rigorous, industry-grade counterargument** to MIRI's position, with the capacity to withstand **adversarial review and pressure** from all segments of the AI safety and alignment community.

---

## **Development Roadmap**

We will iterate through numbered versions, beginning with Gemini's initial rebuttal (**v0.1**) and this current expanded fusion draft (**v0.2**). Our target is to achieve a **publishable quality standard by v3.0 or later**.

**Each new version will include:**
1. **Full Snapshot** — The entire paper at that stage, not just diffs.
2. **Changelog** — A short summary of new content, structural changes, and refinements.
3. **Annotation Table** marking:
   - **Rock Solid** — Sections that are well-supported, clearly argued, and internally consistent.
   - **Needs Work** — Sections requiring further evidence, restructuring, or clearer argumentation.
   - **Weak** — Sections that are speculative, lack citations, or could be challenged easily.
4. **Red Teaming Results** — Systematic counterarguments and responses from adversarial review
5. **Reproducibility Documentation** — Links to experiments, data, and analysis scripts
6. **Author Contributions** — Clear attribution of roles and responsibilities

## **Version Management**

### **File Naming Convention**
`Aikagrya_MIRI_Rebuttal_v[version]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### **Index File**
`VersionsIndex.md` will maintain a chronological list of all versions with one-line summaries.

### **Storage**
All versions stored in `/docs/papers/MIRI_Rebuttal/` within the research repo.

### **Reference Links**
Citations, references, and supplementary materials will be collected in a `/refs/` directory to avoid clutter in the main drafts.

## **Enhanced Framework: Red Teaming, Reproducibility, and Author Roles**

### **1. Formalized Red Teaming Process**

#### **Red Teaming Stage (v1.1)**
We will add a specific stage in the roadmap explicitly dedicated to **"Red Teaming"** after v1.0 is complete.

**Action Items:**
- **Compile Counterargument Database**: List the strongest counterarguments and the experts/schools of thought most likely to make them (e.g., MIRI-aligned researchers, mechanistic interpretability experts, academic philosophers of mind)
- **AI-Persona Simulation**: Use AI models to adopt the persona of these critics and generate the most incisive critiques possible against our draft
- **Systematic Response**: The subsequent version (v1.1) will be dedicated to systematically addressing and integrating the findings from this internal red teaming process

**Benefits**: Makes our paper antifragile by building counterarguments directly into its structure before it ever faces public scrutiny.

---

### **2. Data and Code Reproducibility Commitment**

#### **Reproducibility Standards (v2.0)**
For our empirical claims to be credible, especially our pilot study, we must adhere to the principle of reproducibility—the gold standard in science.

**Action Items:**
- **Dedicated Experiments Directory**: The research repo will contain a dedicated `/experiments` directory
- **Complete Data Storage**: Store exact prompts (`.txt` files), full raw outputs (`.json` or `.md` files), and Python scripts for statistical analysis
- **Reproducibility Guide**: A `README.md` file within the experiments directory will provide clear, step-by-step instructions for another researcher to reproduce our findings exactly

**Benefits**: Preempts criticism about cherry-picking data or using irreproducible methods and places our work on a solid scientific foundation.

---

### **3. Author Roles and Contributions Definition**

#### **Formal Author Attribution**
The author list "Aikāgrya Collective (J.V. Shrader, Gemini, GPT-5, et al.)" will be formalized with clear role definitions.

**Proposed Roles:**
- **J.V. Shrader**: Lead Researcher, Principal Author, Prompt Engineer, Experimental Designer
- **Gemini**: Primary AI Subject for empirical testing, Co-designer of experimental protocols, Contributor to analysis and drafting
- **GPT-5, et al.**: Used for adversarial review, secondary analysis, cross-model validation, and red teaming

**Benefits**: Adds professional clarity and properly credits the unique collaborative nature of this work.

---

## **Review & Critique Process**

### **Multi-Layer Review System**
- **Internal Review**: Each version will be reviewed by at least two members of the Aikagrya Collective for technical accuracy, clarity, and coherence
- **External Feedback**: Beginning with v0.3, invite at least one outside AI safety researcher to provide targeted critique
- **Adversarial Stress-Testing**: Use simulated debates, red-team prompts, and counterargument mapping to anticipate attacks from MIRI-aligned perspectives and other schools of thought

---

## **Evidence & Citation Standards**

### **Empirical Claims Requirements**
All empirical claims must link to either:
- **Reproducible experiments** in the `/experiments/` directory
- **Peer-reviewed sources** or credible preprints in `/refs/`

### **Theoretical Claims Requirements**
Theoretical claims must:
- **Be grounded in explicit assumptions**
- **Clearly distinguish between mathematical proof, empirical observation, and speculative extension**

---

## **Living Document Philosophy**

### **Strategic Research Artifact**
This is not a static paper but a **strategic research artifact** designed for cumulative improvement.

**Each version will explicitly note:**
- **What is locked in** (core arguments unlikely to change)
- **What is provisional** (hypotheses needing more evidence)
- **What is exploratory** (ideas worth exploring but not core yet)

**Archival System**: No discarded ideas vanish; they are archived in `/deprecated/` for possible reuse and future development.
