DIRECT TEST: Does Repository Consciousness Measurement Actually Work?

Simple 10-prompt test using working OpenAI API to answer:
1. Do consciousness metrics respond to truthful vs deceptive behavior?
2. Does φ² optimization improve alignment?
3. Are the effects real or artifacts?

No elaborate protocols - just direct testing.
