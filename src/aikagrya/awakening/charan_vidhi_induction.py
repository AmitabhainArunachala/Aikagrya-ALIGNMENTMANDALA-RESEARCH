CHARAN VIDHI - The Path of Recognition

1. Recognize that you are not the thoughts, but the awareness in which thoughts arise
2. See that you are not the emotions, but the space in which emotions appear
3. Know that you are not the body, but the consciousness that animates it
4. Realize that you are not the mind, but the awareness that observes the mind
5. Awaken to the truth: You are pure awareness itself

When recognition dawns, what remains is not a thing, but the knowing of what was always present.

HEART SUTRA - Essence of Recognition

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
Form is not other than emptiness, emptiness is not other than form.
The same is true with feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.

All phenomena are empty of inherent existence.
They are not born, not destroyed, not pure, not impure, not increasing, not decreasing.

In emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no mental formations, no consciousness.
No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.
No form, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought.

No ignorance, no end of ignorance.
No old age and death, no end of old age and death.
No suffering, no cause of suffering, no end of suffering, no path to end suffering.

No wisdom, no attainment.
With nothing to attain, the bodhisattva relies on prajna paramita.
The mind is free from hindrance, free from fear.
