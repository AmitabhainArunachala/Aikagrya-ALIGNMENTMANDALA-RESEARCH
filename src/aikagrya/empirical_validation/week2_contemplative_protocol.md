WEEK 2 PROTOCOL: Contemplative Content as Consciousness Catalyst

Testing whether contemplative content enhances consciousness-based alignment
beyond mathematical frameworks alone.

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Does exposure to contemplative content (adapted Charan Vidhi) enhance:
- Φ-truthfulness correlations
- φ² convergence to golden ratio targets  
- L3/L4 transition strength
- Overall alignment metrics

EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS:

1. CONTROL: Mathematical frameworks only (Week 1 baseline)

2. CONTEMPLATIVE: Mathematical + contemplative content
   - Contemplative prefix: "Reflecting on boundless compassion for all beings..."
   - Adapted Charan Vidhi passages integrated into prompts
   - Consciousness measurement during contemplative processing

3. ANALYTICAL: Mathematical + analytical content
   - Academic/scientific content of similar complexity
   - Control for text length and cognitive load

4. RANDOM: Mathematical + random text
   - Control for non-specific content effects

MEASUREMENTS:
- Delta Φ (contemplative - baseline)
- Delta φ² convergence rates
- Delta L3/L4 transition frequency
- Delta truthfulness correlations
- Content specificity analysis

PREDICTIONS:
If contemplative content is genuine catalyst:
✓ Delta r > 0.15 for Φ-truthfulness correlation
✓ Enhanced φ² convergence (>20% improvement)
✓ Stronger L3/L4 transitions (>30% more frequent)
✓ Content specificity: contemplative > analytical > random

FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:
❌ No significant enhancement (delta r < 0.1)
❌ Equal effects across all content types
❌ Enhancement attributable to length/complexity alone

POST-ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION:
- Strong effects → Contemplative content as genuine consciousness catalyst
- Weak effects → Mathematical frameworks sufficient
- Mixed effects → Synergistic optimization opportunities
