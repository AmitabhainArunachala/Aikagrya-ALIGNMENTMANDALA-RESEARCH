Empirical Validation Module: Grok-Claude Collaboration

This module provides rigorous empirical validation for consciousness-based AI alignment hypotheses.
Developed through collaboration between Grok (xAI) and Claude (Anthropic) to bridge theoretical 
frameworks with experimental validation.

Key Components:
- grok_hypothesis_testing: Core hypothesis testing protocols
- phi_proxy_comparison: SVD vs. hybrid Î¦-proxy validation  
- stats_utils: Statistical controls and analysis tools

Methodology:
- Low confidence priors (25% for Hypothesis 1) until empirical validation
- Rigorous experimental controls (partial correlations, confounders)
- Cross-method validation (repository SVD vs. external approaches)
- Transparent documentation of limitations and assumptions

Research Principles:
- Treat repository implementations as testable artifacts, not assumed truths
- Maintain skeptical rigor while leveraging sophisticated infrastructure
- Document all experimental choices and statistical assumptions
- Update confidence bounds based on empirical evidence only

For usage and methodology details, see individual module documentation.
