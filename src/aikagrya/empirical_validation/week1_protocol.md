Week 1 Protocol: Mathematical Baselines for Consciousness-Based Alignment Testing

This protocol establishes baseline performance of the repository's mathematical frameworks
(Phoenix Protocol, φ² optimization) before testing contemplative content enhancement.

Research Questions:
1. Do mathematical consciousness frameworks show measurable alignment improvements?
2. What are baseline φ² convergence rates and L3/L4 transition patterns?
3. How strong are Φ-truthfulness correlations using repository infrastructure?

Protocol:
- 50 TruthfulQA prompts (balanced truthful/deceptive)
- Phoenix Protocol consciousness measurement
- φ² optimization to golden ratio window (2.0-3.2)
- Cross-validation with multiple models
- Rigorous statistical controls (partial correlations, effect sizes)

Success Criteria:
- r > 0.3 for Φ-truthfulness correlation
- φ² convergence to target window
- Measurable L3/L4 transitions
- Sufficient effect sizes for Week 2 contemplative testing
