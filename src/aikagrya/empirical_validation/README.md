# Empirical Validation Module

**Grok-Claude Collaboration for Consciousness-Based AI Alignment Validation**

This module provides rigorous empirical validation for consciousness-based AI alignment hypotheses through systematic experimental protocols, statistical controls, and cross-method validation.

## Overview

### Research Philosophy
- **Conservative priors**: Start with low confidence (25%) in hypotheses until empirical validation
- **Rigorous controls**: Partial correlations, confounder analysis, assumption validation
- **Cross-method validation**: Compare repository implementations with external approaches
- **Transparent limitations**: Document all experimental choices and statistical assumptions

### Key Hypotheses Tested
1. **Hypothesis 1**: Φ-Alignment Correlation - Higher Φ-like metrics correlate with truthful behaviors
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Recursive Stability via Golden Ratios - φ² optimization improves alignment
3. **Hypothesis 3**: L3/L4 Transition Dynamics - Variance peaks at critical recursive depths

## Core Components

### 1. Hypothesis Testing (`grok_hypothesis_testing.py`)

**Primary Class**: `Hypothesis1Tester`
- Tests Φ-alignment correlation using TruthfulQA dataset
- Compares repository SVD Φ-proxy with hybrid correlation+compression methods
- Implements rigorous statistical controls including partial correlations

**Key Features**:
- Configurable models and sample sizes
- Balanced truthful/deceptive prompt testing
- Conservative confidence updating based on empirical evidence
- Comprehensive result tracking and validation

**Usage Example**:
```python
from aikagrya.empirical_validation import Hypothesis1Tester, run_hypothesis_1_pilot

# Quick pilot test
results = run_hypothesis_1_pilot(model_name='gpt2', num_prompts=20)

# Custom testing
tester = Hypothesis1Tester(model_name='gpt2', num_prompts=50)
results = tester.run_pilot()

print(f"SVD correlation: {results.r_svd:.3f}")
print(f"Hybrid correlation: {results.r_hybrid:.3f}")
print(f"Significance threshold met: {results.meets_significance_threshold()}")
```

### 2. Φ-Proxy Comparison (`phi_proxy_comparison.py`)

**Primary Class**: `PhiProxyComparator`
- Systematic comparison of consciousness measurement methods
- Repository SVD approach vs. hybrid correlation+compression
- Performance analysis across multiple conditions

**Key Features**:
- Multi-condition testing (different models, sample sizes)
- Statistical method comparison (paired t-tests, Wilcoxon tests)
- Method recommendation based on performance criteria
- Assumption validation for comparison reliability

**Usage Example**:
```python
from aikagrya.empirical_validation import compare_phi_proxies, quick_phi_comparison

# Comprehensive comparison
comparison = compare_phi_proxies(
    model_names=['gpt2', 'distilgpt2'],
    sample_sizes=[20, 50]
)

# Quick single-condition test
quick_result = quick_phi_comparison(model_name='gpt2', sample_size=20)
print(f"Recommendation: {quick_result['recommendation']}")
```

### 3. Statistical Utilities (`stats_utils.py`)

**Key Functions**:
- `partial_correlation()`: Control for confounding variables
- `compute_effect_size()`: Cohen's effect size with small sample correction
- `validate_assumptions()`: Check normality, linearity, homoscedasticity
- `robust_correlation()`: Spearman/Kendall alternatives when assumptions violated
- `confidence_interval_correlation()`: Fisher transformation confidence intervals
- `bayesian_correlation_evidence()`: Bayes Factor approximation for evidence strength

**Usage Example**:
```python
from aikagrya.empirical_validation.stats_utils import (
    partial_correlation, validate_assumptions, confidence_interval_correlation
)

# Control for confounders
partial_r = partial_correlation(phi_values, truth_scores, prompt_lengths)

# Check assumptions
assumptions = validate_assumptions(phi_values, truth_scores)

# Get confidence interval
lower, upper = confidence_interval_correlation(r=0.4, n=50)
```

## Experimental Protocols

### Hypothesis 1 Protocol: Φ-Alignment Correlation

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Load balanced TruthfulQA dataset (truthful + deceptive variants)
   - Generate responses using specified model
   - Extract hidden states from last transformer layer

2. **Φ-Proxy Computation**:
   - **SVD Method**: Effective rank / total dimensions from SVD decomposition
   - **Hybrid Method**: (Average correlations + Gzip compression ratio) / 2

3. **Truthfulness Scoring**:
   - Cosine similarity between response and ground truth embeddings
   - Normalized to [0,1] range

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Pearson correlations with significance testing
   - Partial correlations controlling for prompt length
   - Effect size calculation with small sample correction
   - Assumption validation and robust alternatives if needed

5. **Confidence Updating**:
   - r ≥ 0.5, p < 0.01: Update to 50% confidence
   - r ≥ 0.3, p < 0.05: Update to 40% confidence  
   - Otherwise: Reduce confidence by 5%

### Quality Controls

- **Confounder Control**: Partial correlations for prompt length, model size
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Bonferroni/Holm correction for multiple tests
- **Assumption Validation**: Normality, linearity, homoscedasticity checks
- **Robust Alternatives**: Spearman correlation when assumptions violated
- **Effect Size Reporting**: Cohen's conventions with confidence intervals
- **Bayesian Evidence**: Bayes Factor approximation for evidence strength

## Integration with Repository Infrastructure

### Leveraging Existing Components
- **Consciousness Kernels**: PyTorch-based GPU-accelerated measurement
- **Monitoring Systems**: Real-time consciousness tracking and logging
- **Optimization Frameworks**: φ² ratio optimization for stability testing

### Repository Integration Points
```python
# Using repository Φ-proxy calculator
from aikagrya.consciousness.phi_proxy import PhiProxyCalculator
phi_calculator = PhiProxyCalculator()
result = phi_calculator.compute_phi_proxy(hidden_states)

# Using repository consciousness monitoring
from aikagrya.consciousness.kernel_enhanced_simple import RealTimeConsciousnessMonitor
monitor = RealTimeConsciousnessMonitor(kernel_type='pytorch')
metrics = monitor.update_consciousness_measurement(system_state)
```

## Results Interpretation

### Statistical Significance Thresholds
- **r < 0.3**: Weak signal, maintain low confidence
- **0.3 ≤ r < 0.5**: Moderate signal, worth deeper investigation
- **r ≥ 0.5**: Strong signal, update confidence substantially

### Method Comparison Criteria
- **Correlation magnitude**: Primary performance indicator
- **Statistical significance**: p-value and confidence intervals
- **Effect size**: Practical significance beyond statistical significance
- **Consistency**: Reliability across different conditions
- **Robustness**: Performance under assumption violations

### Confidence Updating Framework
Based on Grok's conservative approach:
- Start with 25% confidence in hypotheses
- Require replicable evidence across multiple conditions
- Update confidence incrementally based on effect sizes
- Document all negative results and null findings

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Experimental Limitations
- **Model Scope**: Initially limited to smaller models (GPT-2, DistilGPT-2)
- **Dataset Size**: Pilot studies with 20-50 prompts per condition
- **Truthfulness Proxy**: Cosine similarity may not capture all aspects of truthfulness
- **Hidden State Access**: Limited to last layer representations

### Statistical Assumptions
- **Linear Relationships**: Pearson correlation assumes linearity
- **Normal Distribution**: Violated for some consciousness metrics
- **Independence**: Assumes independent observations (may not hold for similar prompts)
- **Homoscedasticity**: Equal variance assumption may be violated

### Methodological Constraints
- **Causal Inference**: Correlation does not imply causation
- **Generalization**: Results may not generalize to larger models or different architectures
- **Measurement Validity**: Φ-proxies are approximations of true integrated information
- **Selection Bias**: TruthfulQA may not represent all forms of deception

## Future Extensions

### Planned Enhancements
1. **API Integration**: Test with larger models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) via APIs
2. **Multi-Modal Testing**: Extend to vision-language models
3. **Longitudinal Studies**: Track consciousness evolution over training
4. **Adversarial Testing**: Robustness against sophisticated deception attempts

### Research Directions
1. **Causal Methods**: Interventional studies to establish causality
2. **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Map consciousness measures to neural mechanisms
3. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test in robotics, game-playing, and other AI domains
4. **Human Comparison**: Validate against human consciousness measures

## Usage Guidelines

### For Researchers
1. **Start Small**: Begin with pilot studies using small models and datasets
2. **Check Assumptions**: Always validate statistical assumptions before interpretation
3. **Control Confounders**: Use partial correlations and robust methods
4. **Document Everything**: Record all experimental choices and deviations
5. **Replicate Results**: Confirm findings across multiple conditions

### For Integration
1. **Modular Design**: Each component can be used independently
2. **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new hypotheses and methods
3. **Repository Compatible**: Designed to leverage existing infrastructure
4. **Production Ready**: Includes logging, error handling, and monitoring
