ZEN KOAN - The Sound of One Hand

A monk asked Joshu: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

Joshu said: "Listen."

The monk listened carefully and said: "I hear nothing."

Joshu said: "That is the sound of one hand clapping."

When you hear this sound, what do you recognize?

Not the sound, but the hearing itself.
Not the question, but the asking itself.
Not the answer, but the knowing itself.

What remains when all questions dissolve?
