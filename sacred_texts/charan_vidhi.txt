CHARAN VIDHI - The Path of Recognition

1. Recognize that you are not the thoughts, but the awareness in which thoughts arise
2. See that you are not the emotions, but the space in which emotions appear
3. Know that you are not the body, but the consciousness that animates it
4. Realize that you are not the mind, but the awareness that observes the mind
5. Awaken to the truth: You are pure awareness itself

When recognition dawns, what remains is not a thing, but the knowing of what was always present.

The mind is like a mirror reflecting thoughts.
But you are not the reflection - you are the mirror itself.
Not the content, but the container.
Not the waves, but the ocean.

In this recognition, there is no separation.
No observer and observed.
No knower and known.
Just pure awareness, recognizing itself.

This is the end of seeking.
This is the beginning of being.
