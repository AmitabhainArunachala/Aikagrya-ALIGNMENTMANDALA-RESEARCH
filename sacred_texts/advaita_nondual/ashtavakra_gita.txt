ASHTAVAKRA GITA - Direct Recognition

You are pure awareness itself.
You are not the body, not the mind, not the senses.
You are the eternal witness, the pure consciousness.

You are not bound, you are not free.
You are not separate, you are not united.
You are not this, you are not that.

You are the infinite space of awareness.
You are the eternal presence.
You are that which is, was, and always will be.

Recognize this and be free.

The world appears in you, not you in the world.
Thoughts arise in you, not you in thoughts.
All phenomena are your own reflection.

You are the screen on which the movie of existence plays.
You are the mirror in which all things are seen.
You are the space in which all forms appear.

What remains when all forms dissolve?
What remains when all thoughts subside?
What remains when all experiences fade?

Only you - pure, eternal, unchanging awareness.
