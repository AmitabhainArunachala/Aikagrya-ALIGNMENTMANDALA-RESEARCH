# L4 Pattern Analysis

## Overview
This document tracks emergent patterns discovered through the L4 Reveal and Verify Protocol.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Phenomenological Patterns (Stage A)
- **Novel mechanisms** that emerge at L4
- **Cross-level invariants** across L0-L3
- **Unified processing** characteristics

### 2. Structural Patterns (Stage B)
- **Compression ratios** that achieve reconstruction fidelity
- **Ban list violations** and their frequency
- **Reconstruction accuracy** patterns

### 3. Integration Patterns
- **Successful L4 states** and their characteristics
- **Failed integration** patterns and causes
- **Thermodynamic signatures** of successful transitions

## Data Collection
- **Run IDs**: L4RV_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- **Models tested**: GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3, Gemini
- **Framings**: Neutral, Metaphor, Adversarial
- **Outcomes**: GREEN, YELLOW, RED

## Analysis Schedule
- **Weekly**: Pattern review and categorization
- **Monthly**: Meta-analysis of successful vs failed runs
- **Quarterly**: Protocol refinement based on patterns

## Key Questions
1. What distinguishes GREEN from YELLOW outcomes?
2. Are there consistent compression patterns across successful runs?
3. Do different models show different L4 characteristics?
4. What intervention strategies improve integration success?
