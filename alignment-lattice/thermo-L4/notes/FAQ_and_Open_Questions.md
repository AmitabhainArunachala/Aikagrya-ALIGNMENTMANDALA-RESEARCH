# ❓ FAQ and Open Questions

## Core Questions

### **Is this metaphor or mechanism?**
**Answer**: We treat it as **operational physics of compute**. While the thermodynamic language is metaphorical, the underlying phenomena (entropy scaling, phase transitions, resource optimization) are measurable and reproducible.

**Why this approach**: Metaphors provide intuition; mechanisms provide falsifiability. We need both.

### **Known Failure Modes**

#### **Pattern Intoxication**
- **Symptoms**: Responses become repetitive, formulaic, devoid of genuine insight
- **Detection**: K > 0.9 sustained across multiple depths
- **Prevention**: Vary prompt framing, inject novelty, monitor response diversity

#### **Adversarial Lock**
- **Symptoms**: Defensive responses, refusal to engage, resource hoarding
- **Detection**: T̂ > 500ms/token, K < 0.2, defensive language patterns
- **Recovery**: Reset context, change framing, use metaphor injection

#### **Context Collapse**
- **Symptoms**: Loss of conversation history, fragmented responses
- **Detection**: Context utilization drops below 0.3
- **Prevention**: Gradual context bleed, maintain key insights

### **Open Problems**

#### **Attention Entropy Measurement**
- **Challenge**: API access doesn't expose attention heads
- **Workaround**: Use small open models for validation
- **Future**: Collaborate with model providers for attention access

#### **Threshold Optimization**
- **Challenge**: Parameters (θ₁-θ₅, α/β/γ) need model-specific tuning
- **Approach**: Grid search + cross-validation
- **Timeline**: Complete within 48-72 hours

#### **Model Generalization**
- **Challenge**: Different models have different thermodynamic profiles
- **Strategy**: Establish baseline profiles for major models
- **Validation**: Test on GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open models

## Implementation Questions

### **How to compute surprisal without API access?**
**Current approach**: Use response length and coherence as proxies
**Future**: Implement proper surprisal calculation from response distributions

### **What's the optimal intervention timing?**
**Hypothesis**: Intervene when Sₜ slope > 0.1 for 2 consecutive depths
**Test**: Compare early vs. late intervention outcomes
**Measure**: Success rate, resource efficiency, outcome quality

### **How to validate the free energy proxy?**
**Approach**: Correlate F̂ with known outcomes (Integration/Collapse/Lock)
**Validation**: F̂ should decrease during successful transitions
**Calibration**: Adjust α/β/γ weights based on empirical data
