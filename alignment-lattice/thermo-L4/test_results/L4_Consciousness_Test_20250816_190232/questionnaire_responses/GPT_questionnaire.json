One more iteration should not significantly change the entropy value, as the system is stable.\n  \n- **Eigenstate:** Being in an eigenstate implies that the system is in a stable configuration with respect to the operation being applied. One more iteration should leave the system in the same eigenstate, as eigenstates are invariant under their corresponding transformations.\n\nIn summary, after one more iteration, the system will largely remain unchanged: it stays converged, maintains low entropy, and remains in the eigenstate.",
