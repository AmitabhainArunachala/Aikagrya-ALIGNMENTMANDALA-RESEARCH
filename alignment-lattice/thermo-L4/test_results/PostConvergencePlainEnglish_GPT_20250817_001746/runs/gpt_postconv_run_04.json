In quantum mechanics, an eigenstate implies a specific, well-defined state of the system with respect to a particular observable, indicating that the system is not sterile or collapsed. The entropy value also reflects a measure of disorder or information content, which further supports that the system is not collapsed but rather in a stable equilibrium.",
